# SQ – Build Plan (Astro + Netlify)

> **Σκοπός:** Pilot static site (Astro) μέχρι τέλη Σεπτεμβρίου, με ελάχιστο κόστος και πλήρη ιδιοκτησία.  
> **Stack:** Astro · Netlify · Lemon Squeezy · MailerLite · Tailwind · Markdown.

Alright—let’s simplify and focus on one clear next action.

🏁 Where we stand (all done)

1. Dev environment: Astro + Tailwind setup, Git → Netlify CI  
2. Layout: Base layout with header/nav/footer  
3. Content: Blog list, dynamic post routes, draft handling  
4. Forms: Netlify contact form live + submissions arriving

🎯 Your next single step

We now move from “wiring up” features to designing the site’s look. Pick one of these to start:

| Option      | What it means                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Theme       | Configure fonts/colors in tailwind.config.mjs              |
| Home Hero   | Build a hero banner component for the homepage             |
| Blog Cards  | Style your blog index as a grid of cards with hover        |
| Components  | Scaffold a reusable `<Button>` or `<Card>` component       |

Tell me which one sounds best—e.g. “Let’s do Theme” or “Start Blog Cards”—and I’ll give you that exact next step, no extra noise.
