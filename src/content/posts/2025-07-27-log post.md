Alright—let’s simplify and focus on one clear next action.

⸻

🏁 Where we stand (all done) 1. Dev environment: Astro + Tailwind setup, Git → Netlify CI 2. Layout: Base layout with header/nav/footer 3. Content: Blog list, dynamic post routes, draft handling 4. Forms: Netlify contact form live + submissions arriving

⸻

🎯 Your next single step

We now move from “wiring up” features to designing the site’s look. Pick one of these to start:

Option What it means
Theme Configure fonts/colors in tailwind.config.mjs
Home Hero Build a hero banner component for the homepage
Blog Cards Style your blog index as a grid of cards with hover
Components Scaffold a reusable <Button> or <Card> component

Tell me which one sounds best—e.g. “Let’s do Theme” or “Start Blog Cards”—and I’ll give you that exact next step, no extra noise.
